          <h2>Come explore science with us</h2>
          <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
            This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
            explore.</p>
          <p>Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see
            science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when
            everyone’s gone home).</p>

            <p>Our new exhibition space is opening may 2021 - we are so excited to welcome you to explore
              the
              wonders of our cosmos. This fantastic exhibition, «The Sky Above Us», will explore the night
              sky
              and what we can see and know about the universe around us. </p>
            <p>We’ll locate the various
              constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who
              used
              the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
              traders, to
              Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
              Where
              do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we
              have
              had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world. </p>
            <p>Discover the origins of
              life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also
              take
              some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth,
              the
              Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

            <h3>Biology and medicine</h3>
            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
              insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. </p>
            <p>For many people their life expectancy is much
              longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
              medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at
              some
              major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
            </p>
            <p>Many
              of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
              animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

            <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
            <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science
              of
              the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future
              is
              here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot. </p>

            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important
              it
              becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but
              for
              the whole planet. </p>
            <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
              including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the
              positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
