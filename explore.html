                        discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world
                        around us.</p>

            <h3>For kids</h3>


            <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science?</p>
            <p>Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to
                see and do. You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time
                and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds,
                so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.</p>
            <p> We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a
                week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of
                experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your
                age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.</p>
            <p> To find out more about
                the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.</p>

                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
                    do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have
                    had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world. </p>
                <p>Discover the origins of
                    life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take
                    some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
                    Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h3>Biology and medicine</h3>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                    insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. </p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much
                    longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
                    medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some
                    major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
                <p>Many
                    of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
                    animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of
                    the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
                    here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot. </p>

                <h3>Ecology</h3>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                    becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for
                    the whole planet. </p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                    including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the
                    positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
